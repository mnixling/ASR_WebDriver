This is an ASR-WebDriver. It allows you to search with voice commands. It works fairly well searching with Google.

It is probably easiest to build this in an IDE using Java. I used Eclipse Photon. Once you have built the ASR-WebDriver you can issue the 
following commands:

1. Google (this will open a chrome browser--providing you did not change anything)
2. just say what you want to search for
3. Say 'Open' and the  first returned link should open.

It is possible to access different sites instead of just Google.com upon starting the WebDriver. This was built specifically to open to Google.com 
to begin a search and open a returned link.
